# Advanced Algorithms Repository

This repository is dedicated to implementing and exploring **Advanced Algorithms** studied during the **Computer Science – AI/ML** undergraduate program (1st to 8th semester).

The main objective is to **write my own implementations** of algorithms (without copy–pasting internet code), to strengthen my problem-solving and coding skills.

---

## 📌 What’s Inside

- Algorithms discussed in class/lectures across all semesters.
- My personal implementations (C++(mostly)/Java/other languages).

---

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. Study and understand the algorithm’s theory.
2. Write implementation in code.
3. Add comments and explanations for clarity.
4. Push it here for tracking and sharing.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen my fundamentals by coding what I study.
